Hello! I'm a data scientist currently working at Orbitware.

I'm interested in MLOps, GenAI and Data Visualization. My favorite programming language is R, but I also work with Python.

For more info about me, I have a portfolio website where you can also find my blog in the next link:

## Projects
Here you can find a dashboard that I made from Spotify data, where you can observe music features through the years:
